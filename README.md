## Description
For this assignment, my objective was to make a marketing agency's website more accessible to users. I was given an original HTML and original CSS file; my task was to essentially clean the files up, thus making the web page more accessible to users. Making the website more accessible allows for a broader audience to view and understand the content on the web page. But this begs the question: how do you define the term "accessible"?

Simple. In terms of code, we start by taking the "Scout Rule" approach. You might be wondering what that means. The "Scout Rule" essentially states that whoever is writing, debugging, or editing code should leave the code cleaner/more organized than how they found it. Even something as simple as proper indentations and lining up the elements to their corresponding elements can go a long way.

Next step: consolidation. Here's the truth: code can get messy. When this happens, one must examine the mess itself to determine why it looks that way in the first place. For example, in this assignment, I noticed a TON of repetitive code. This code needed consolidation; it needed to be simplified while retaining the web page's original properties. This code needed a *hero* to come save the day and make the webpage more accessible to web surfers.

This assignment motivated me to be that hero!! *Cues "Avengers" Soundtrack*

## Motivation
This assignment exists to highlight the importance of the "Scout Rule" as well as consolidating repetitive code.

Not only was I motivated to clean up the code; I wanted to take it a step further and add a touch of "Alex" to the website.

Spoiler alert: my finishing touch was making the "seo" in "Horiseon" neon orange.

As you can see, I started with something simple by changing the "Seo" from the greyish color as shown above to a neon orange (see below).

## Major Changes

Enough of the neon orange; let's move on to the consolidation. This, by far and away, took up the bulk of my labor.

As shown above, the original CSS code is very repetitive and could definitely use some condensing. See below for results.

Just to clarify, these two codes accomplish the same thing. The differentiating factor is the readability between the lengthy original CSS and the new-and-improved CSS code.
